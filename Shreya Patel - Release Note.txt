Shreya Patel - Release Note

Game Project: Bunny, Where are You?
Creator: Shreya Patel
Version: 2.0
Date: 27 January 2026

New Features:
- Two endings instead of one.
- Added a puzzle element with having to find a key for the pantry door.
- Pantry has a carrot mechanic that when picked up, lures Bunny back to her enclosure.
- Even after unlocking the pantry, the player can still choose to go around and try to get the other ending where they find Bunny and interact with furniture.
- Transitions added for room changes.

Fixes:
- Dialogues now have page breaks so sentences don't overlap in one dialogue box.
- Bunny isn't visibly obvious anymore and is a question mark instead.

Improvements:
- Each sentence has a page break for better visuals and understanding when reading.
- Bunny is now a question mark just like the others so the player doesn't spot her immediately.
- Instead of a question mark in the pantry, it is now a carrot.

Known Bugs:
- There weren't any known bugs.
